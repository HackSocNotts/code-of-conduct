# HackSoc Code of Conduct

_Updated: September 21st, 2020_

## 1. Purpose
A primary goal of HackSoc is to be inclusive to the largest number of members, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our society, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in HackSoc to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Open Tech Citizenship
A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open tech citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our society.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our society is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## 3. Expected Behavior
The following behaviors are expected and requested of all society members:

 - Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this society.
 - Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
 - Attempt collaboration before conflict.
 - Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
 - Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert committee members, appointed deputies, or relevant university or union staff if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
 - Remember that society event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.
 
## 4. Unacceptable Behavior
The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within the society:

- Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.

## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
Unacceptable behavior from any attendee or society member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If an attendee or society member engages in unacceptable behavior, the committee members, their apointed deputiees, or relevant members of university of union staff may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the society without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).
